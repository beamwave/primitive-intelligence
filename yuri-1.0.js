  "Through the millennia, man kind has shown many facets of adaptability, to an ever changing, ever evolving climate. With the rise and fall and changing hands of power of the political landscapes across the globes, many branches of society have been birthed. In one such instance, is the 21st century, 'Modern.... Nerd'. Often likened to primates in the wild, these somewhat civilized people spend vastly extravegent amounts of time gazing in to a void. Life seen through a screen, the ultimate acclimatisation. And yet, something very strange begins to happen. The Nerds begin to compete for power; unable to attain power in the world outside of the internet. Not unlike the bower bird, collecting blue shards to attract a mate, the nerds store large amounts of data which they feel replicates their idea of themselves, and thus, the Nerd's strive to compete for attention and mate hood.",
